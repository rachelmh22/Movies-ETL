# Movies-ETL

## Purpose

This purpose of this project is to use the Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process to create a data pipeline in order to prepare clean data for a hackathon. We need to gather data from both Wikipedia and Kaggle, combine them, and save them into a SQL database so that the hackathon participants have a nice, clean dataset to use. 

## Deliverables for Module 8 Challenge
- Write an ETL Function to Read Three Data Files
- Extract and Transform the Wikipedia Data
- Extract and Transform the Kaggle data
- Create the Movie Database
