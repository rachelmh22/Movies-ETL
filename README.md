# Movies-ETL

## Purpose

This purpose of this repository is to upload the deliverables for module 8 challenge. In this module, we learn to use the Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process to create a data pipeline in order to prepare clean data for a hackathon. We need to collect the data, combine them, and load it into a SQL database. This will create clean data that can be analyzed.

## Deliverables for Module 8 Challenge
- Write an ETL Function to Read Three Data Files
- Extract and Transform the Wikipedia Data
- Extract and Transform the Kaggle data
- Create the Movie Database
